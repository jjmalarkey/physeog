# physeog
Physeog / Magus is a roguelike project styled as an intersection between CDDA / Caves of Qud and Noita. The imperative is a magic system and an environment system that are complementary - allowing manipulation of the environment using magic, and using the environment to impact the use of magic.

This game reflects some ideas from a school project I participated in called Quadratic Wizard, a magic-focused roguelike written in Rust using the Bracket-Lib RLTK engine. Currently this game project will make use of the same engine.
